# 💊 Pharmacy Inventory Management System (C Project)

## 📄 Abstract
The **Pharmacy Inventory Management System** is a simple, terminal-based application written in **C**, designed to manage medicine inventory efficiently.  
It supports adding new medicines, searching by ID, updating stock details, and deleting records.  
All data is saved persistently in a **binary file (`pharmacy.dat`)**, ensuring availability across sessions.

This project demonstrates essential C programming concepts such as **file handling, structures, arrays, and menu-driven flow**, making it ideal for beginners and small pharmacy or medical store setups.
